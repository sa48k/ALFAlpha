# ALFAlpha (2020)

A Google Apps Script tool that allows Amesbury teachers to post evidence of students' learning to the school's custom LMS (Amesbury Learning Framework a.k.a. ALF) through a Google Form, without interacting with the ALF website.

Reduced wait time for teachers from 2 minutes to near-zero for every post they made. Added the feature to post to multiple students at the same time.
